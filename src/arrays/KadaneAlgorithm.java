     * Approach: 1
     * <p>
     *     Take two variables one will store the sum and one will store the maxSum. Now iterate through array and add
     *     elements one by one and in every iteration check if maxSum is less than the sum, if it is less than simply
     *     make maxSum equals to sum. And in every iteration keep checking if the sum is not less than zero, if it is
     *     becoming negative then make it zero. Keep it until last element and simply return the maxSum.
